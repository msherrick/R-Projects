# R-Projects
This repository includes all the projects I have completed using R throughout my undergraduate years at Wake Forest University.
The Senior Thesis file is the thesis I wrote to complete my degree in Mathematical Statistics at Wake Forest University. Using data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and statistical procedures, I worked on a dataset with NFL statistics and made data-driven predictions on future Hall of Fame inductions. The dataset used to complete this assignment can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/kendallgillies/nflstatistics. I wrote my entire thesis using RStudio.

The Red Wine Quality file is my final project for a statistical learning course I took at Wake Forest. It includes using exploratory data analysis through visualizations and fitting models to determine what physicochemical indexes of wine contributes to a good quality. The dataset can found here: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009.
